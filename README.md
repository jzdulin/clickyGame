# clickyGame

clickyGame is a memory game made using react. The UI is split into separate components.

To play clickyGame simply click on one of the twelve images of League of Legends champions. After one is clicked the images will all shift around. To win you have to click all twelve images without clicking any of them twice. If an image is clicked twice the current score will reset back to 0 and the best score will be set if the current score is higher than the best score was previously. 

Arrays are used to both test and see if an image has already been clicked and to shuffle all of the images around whenever one has been clicked.
